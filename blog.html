		<h2>Assignment 0 Entry - 9/23/2016</h2>
        <div class="Content0">
    	    <p>I was basically clueless coming into this assignment. I completed the tutorials, but the second one ended up confusing me even
    		more after I checked Piazza. Two of the questions, "[Assignment 0] Parts 3 & 4" and "Push & Submit" talked about flip and
    		github (sadly, it took me a few minutes to even figure out what flip was referring to), and I couldn't really tell how the
    		two were related. Thankfully, one of the kind souls in this universe put up some screenshots on Piazza, and after messing
    		around with it a bit, I finally came to the realization that doing the changes on flip or github made little to no
    		difference. After that, I more or less managed to make the edits and what not without too much trouble. If I'm
    		to summarize the troubles I had, it would be that I didn't even understand what flip and github were, nor how the latter
    		worked.</p>
    		<p>As for what I learned, I finally have a grasp on what github is, so I think I can answer some of my questions just by messing around
    		with it for a bit. I also managed to figure out how to connect to my OSU Engineering directory thing as a side effect of said
    		messing around. And lastly, I've definitely seen how useful Piazza is, and I'll probably be relying on it quite a bit for the
    		remainder of the term.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 1 Entry - 10/7/2017</h2>
        <div class="Content1">
            <p>Just like the last assignment, I had zero prior experience with CSS. Since I had figured out how to use git and the lecture had covered
            how to use CSS, I thought that it would be a lot easier than the last one. It wasn't. This assignment, and I guess CSS as a whole, is probably
            one of the most frustrating things I've ever worked through. I don't know if it's better described as challenging or annoying, but figuring out
            which classes/sections/tags to place the code in was a huge issue for me. For example, when I was trying to change the font for the ToDoIt header,
            I placed the font-family and font-size in h1 and it worked. From this, I assumed all "ToDoIt" related edits would be in h1, but text-decoration: none;
            wouldn't work, and neither would color. Honestly, I still don't get why that particular case doesn't work, but I more or less got from that that
            you usually have to be really specific with what part you want changed, or it'll do something unwanted. Also, I found out that simply adding or
            removing single lines of code won't usually tell you where the problem is. Unlike in normal programming, where you comment out certain parts to
            locate the problem, CSS seems to always have multple variable involved in everything. I can't think of a good example, but it's something like when i
            was trying to remove white space between the header and navbar by removing the header's margins, the space wouldn't disappear because the navbar's margins
            were still there. Also, I used display: inline-flex; and flex-wrap: wrap; individually, they wouldn't do what I was hoping for, but when using both, it works.
            Lastly, changing something in the stylesheet and seeing the wrong change in the site is sad, but altering the stylesheet and seeing no change at all is
            probably even worse. At least when i have a syntax error, the compiler just tells it to me straight. Here, I can't tell if the problem is using
            the wrong selector (as in the h1 and h1 a issue i mentioned earlier, or display:inline-block in nav/navbar-list), mixing up the selectors and putting the code in the wrong part (inline-blocking nav or
            navbar instead of navbar-item), simply incorrect syntax (this happened with box-shadow, where i used commas)or if it's technically working,
            just not as i intended (I think this was the case with text-align:right on navbar-item.navbar-right).
            I know those problems might sound a little dumb, but for me, it was a real problem that took hours to figure out.</p>
            <p>That being said, the slow process of solving those problems did give me plenty of time to figure some things out. The fact that i (think) i can explain the reasoning
            behind the problems in my CSS were is something that i definitely couldn't do back when i started this assignment. Although I'm still not completely clear on
            when to use what selectors and classes, I'm confident i can muddle my way through it much faster than before. That is to say, I learned what and where some of the possible
            problems could be, and although I don't necessarily understand why they're causing said problems, because i know where they are, I can just do a ton of guess and check
            to make it work out. </p>
            <p>Sadly, Piazza didn't help as much as it did last time, although i did get a slightly unrelated problem solved there. One of the reasons for this is that, oddly enough, it seems
            like solutions that work for some people don't always work for others, probably because of other variables in their CSS. Honestly, the answers regarding position:fixed and
            position:relative seemed to conflict with each other, making it even more confusing. On the other hand, developer tools were a godsend. Most of my problems regarding selectors
            and classes were resolved using the chrome developer tools, since they allowed me to see what each selector/class was actually pointing to. Specifically, i could indentify things
            like how the classes/selectors were split up between the nav bar items. It helped a lot with changing the padding, margins, and text (which i initially tried to do in just nav and
            navbar-list). I used a random site called w3schools for help with a few pieces of syntax that were unclear from my lecture notes, as well as for picking colors. As for the exact things
            i googled, it was stuff like "css how to align list item to the right" and "Css how to insert space between content and footer". Unfortunetly, I came back empty handed from a lot of
            my searches, since the source of my problems were usually different (like being unable to use text-decoration: none because my selector was wrong), and if anything, it just made things
            more frustrating seeing everyone give an answer that just didn't seem to work for me.
