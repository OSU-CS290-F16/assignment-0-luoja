		<h2>Assignment 0 Entry - 9/23/2016</h2>
        <div class="Content">
    	    <p>I was basically clueless coming into this assignment. I completed the tutorials, but the second one ended up confusing me even
    		more after I checked Piazza. Two of the questions, "[Assignment 0] Parts 3 & 4" and "Push & Submit" talked about flip and
    		github (sadly, it took me a few minutes to even figure out what flip was referring to), and I couldn't really tell how the
    		two were related. Thankfully, one of the kind souls in this universe put up some screenshots on Piazza, and after messing
    		around with it a bit, I finally came to the realization that doing the changes on flip or github made little to no
    		difference. After that, I more or less managed to make the edits and what not without too much trouble. If I'm
    		to summarize the troubles I had, it would be that I didn't even understand what flip and github were, nor how the latter
    		worked.</p>
    		<p>As for what I learned, I finally have a grasp on what github is, so I think I can answer some of my questions just by messing around
    		with it for a bit. I also managed to figure out how to connect to my OSU Engineering directory thing as a side effect of said
    		messing around. And lastly, I've definitely seen how useful Piazza is, and I'll probably be relying on it quite a bit for the
    		remainder of the term.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 1 Entry - 10/7/2016</h2>
        <div class="Content">
            <p>Just like the last assignment, I had zero prior experience with CSS. Since I had figured out how to use git and the lecture had covered
            how to use CSS, I thought that it would be a lot easier than the last one. It wasn't. This assignment, and I guess CSS as a whole, is probably
            one of the most frustrating things I've ever worked through. I don't know if it's better described as challenging or annoying, but figuring out
            which classes/sections/tags to place the code in was a huge issue for me. For example, when I was trying to change the font for the ToDoIt header,
            I placed the font-family and font-size in h1 and it worked. From this, I assumed all "ToDoIt" related edits would be in h1, but text-decoration: none;
            wouldn't work, and neither would color. Honestly, I still don't get why that particular case doesn't work, but I more or less got from that that
            you usually have to be really specific with what part you want changed, or it'll do something unwanted. Also, I found out that simply adding or
            removing single lines of code won't usually tell you where the problem is. Unlike in normal programming, where you comment out certain parts to
            locate the problem, CSS seems to always have multple variable involved in everything. I can't think of a good example, but it's something like when i
            was trying to remove white space between the header and navbar by removing the header's margins, the space wouldn't disappear because the navbar's margins
            were still there. Also, I used display: inline-flex; and flex-wrap: wrap; individually, they wouldn't do what I was hoping for, but when using both, it works.
            Lastly, changing something in the stylesheet and seeing the wrong change in the site is sad, but altering the stylesheet and seeing no change at all is
            probably even worse. At least when i have a syntax error, the compiler just tells it to me straight. Here, I can't tell if the problem is using
            the wrong selector (as in the h1 and h1 a issue i mentioned earlier, or display:inline-block in nav/navbar-list), mixing up the selectors and putting the code in the wrong part (inline-blocking nav or
            navbar instead of navbar-item), simply incorrect syntax (this happened with box-shadow, where i used commas)or if it's technically working,
            just not as i intended (I think this was the case with text-align:right on navbar-item.navbar-right).
            I know those problems might sound a little dumb, but for me, it was a real problem that took hours to figure out.</p>
            <p>That being said, the slow process of solving those problems did give me plenty of time to figure some things out. The fact that i (think) i can explain the reasoning
            behind the problems in my CSS were is something that i definitely couldn't do back when i started this assignment. Although I'm still not completely clear on
            when to use what selectors and classes, I'm confident i can muddle my way through it much faster than before. That is to say, I learned what and where some of the possible
            problems could be, and although I don't necessarily understand why they're causing said problems, because i know where they are, I can just do a ton of guess and check
            to make it work out. </p>
            <p>Sadly, Piazza didn't help as much as it did last time, although i did get a slightly unrelated problem solved there. One of the reasons for this is that, oddly enough, it seems
            like solutions that work for some people don't always work for others, probably because of other variables in their CSS. Honestly, the answers regarding position:fixed and
            position:relative seemed to conflict with each other, making it even more confusing. On the other hand, developer tools were a godsend. Most of my problems regarding selectors
            and classes were resolved using the chrome developer tools, since they allowed me to see what each selector/class was actually pointing to. Specifically, i could indentify things
            like how the classes/selectors were split up between the nav bar items. It helped a lot with changing the padding, margins, and text (which i initially tried to do in just nav and
            navbar-list). I used a random site called w3schools for help with a few pieces of syntax that were unclear from my lecture notes, as well as for picking colors. As for the exact things
            i googled, it was stuff like "css how to align list item to the right" and "Css how to insert space between content and footer". Unfortunetly, I came back empty handed from a lot of
            my searches, since the source of my problems were usually different (like being unable to use text-decoration: none because my selector was wrong), and if anything, it just made things
            more frustrating seeing everyone give an answer that just didn't seem to work for me.

        <h2>Assignment 2 Entry - 10/20/2016</h2>
        <div class="Content">
            <p>I was new to javascript as well when I started this assignment, but to sum it up, this one went much smoother than the last. I spent a few hours on it, but it took less than half
                the time the CSS assignment did, and it was also far less frustrating. A HUGE contributor to this was the example posted on the class site, the DOM Manipulation Fiddle. With CSS,
                i had tons of trouble figuring out what classes i had to use for each change. On the other hand, with this assignment, referencing the example helped a lot with figuring out the whole
                parent/child node concept. It took a while to understand the order i had to append things in, but overall, I definitely felt that javascript was much more direct with what classes you
                had to call for each change. Another thing that helped was the ability to use console.log(event.target) to figure out what you're clicking on. It was a nice way to check to make sure
                i was using the right container/parentNode. The content from the lectures, or rather, my notes from said lectures, also helped a few times with syntax, although i did end up having
                to look up a few as well.
            </p>
            <p>I didn't actually feel that this assignment was challenging. By that, i don't think i mean that it was easy, since it still took a few hours to do. It's more like, compared to the last one,
                this was so much less frustrating that it didn't feel bothersome to do. Most of the times i made a change, it did exactly what i intended it to do. For the times where i got unintended results,
                it didn't take very long to figure out why and to fix it. Comparing that to the last assignment, where i didn't know where or what the problem was 90% of the time, makes this one seem
                fun. I think most people in computer science understand what i mean when i say that going through the coding without encountering any bugs makes you feel sort of accomplished, considering how
                it's usually a "guess and check" ordeal. The hardest part about it was understanding the parent/child node concept at the start, as well as looking up the syntax for doing what i wanted to do.
                Most of it was in the example, but I had trouble remebering parts such as getElementById, and i had to look up things like how to replace/remove a class from an element, or how to set an id
                and type for input elements (to clear the modal, i remade the input elements, so i had to set the type and id before appending them). Stackoverflow answered quite a few of these questions for me,
                although as usual, it took a while to find the answer i wanted (i.e. some used innerHTML). On a side note, i never figured out how to use &amp;times; in javascript, since it would just show up as
                &amp;times; instead of &times;.

        <h2>Assignment 3 Entry - 11/3/2016</h2>
        <div class="Content">
            <p>This assignment was somewhat similar to the javascript assignment for me, in that it didn't take too long, and wasn't all that frustating either. That being said, it was a lot more troublesome
                than the previous assignment, primarily because I felt like I had even less of an idea of what I was doing at the start. The biggest challenge of the entire assignment was probably just getting
                the files to show up. I actually had to search around StackOverflow just to get started with this, and I ran into plenty of problems along the way, one of which was that I had a
                resp.end(); line somewhere in readFile's function, (the end i think?) and apparently it stopped anything from being displayed on the page. I couldn't tell whether or not it was the
                output that wasn't working, or if my inputs for readFile were the problem. Sadly, I didn't have a process for figuring out which one it was, and I couldn't find the answer online either. I just
                had to go through and insert/delete random lines for an hour or two until the ToDoIt page finally showed up. After I got the files to show up, the rest was a lot smoother. I actually didn't
                understand what the assignment meant by "server reads files in public/ exactly once and caches them." until one of the Piazza answers noted that "This would be easier if you read in the contents
                of your files outside your request handling function.". I had to change my code a bit, but the end result felt a lot simpler than what I had originally, to the extent that I thought I might've
                still been interpreting it wrong.
            </p>
            <p>The most helpful resources this time were definitely StackOverflow, and a little bit of Piazza for clarifying one of the assignment requirements. I tried looking at the actual documentation for
                some of the node stuff, but it was definitely too specific/convoluted for me to understand. Something I didn't notice when I was working with javascript before was that the whole nexted functions
                (i don't know what they're actually called, but it's when you define a function on the same line as something else, like http.createServer(function(req, resp){} rather than function handleRequest
                (req,resp){}) thing can be really confusing. I originally had readFile nested inside of createServer, and changing it was actually quite confusing.

        <h2>Assignment 4 Entry - 11/17/2016</h2>
        <div class = "Content">
            <p>
                This assignment took me about 6 or 7 hours, and yes, it was definitely one of those assignments that made me think "Wow, if i had any idea what i was doing when i started, I would've been done so much faster".
                Even for the css assignment that i had so much trouble with, I had an vague understanding of what i was doing, enough that if i could muddle my way through by guessing and checking. For this assignment,
                I had so little understanding of it that a lot of the time was really just spent thinking or testing changes to the code that didn't actually mean anything. I spent quite a while just messing with the demo
                code, trying to figure out which identifiers refered to what (it had people: people and person: person). For example, the first two hours were spent trying to figure out how to get the names onto the select dropdown. Specifically, i couldn't figure
                out what i had to put in the server.js's index-page render to give it users-data.json. When it wasn't working, I couldn't tell whether user-select.handlebars or server.js was the problem. As for learning,
                I seriously feel like i relearnt how useful compilers are, in that they point out syntax errors for you. I had so many typos between users, user, user-data, users-data, userdata, and usersdata that
                by the end of it, I didn't even know if the problem was just a typo or actual syntax. Another example of a stupid wall i ran into was trying to figure out how to get
                the .json keys for the dropdown options. I spent an hour or so googling "how to get json keys", before i finally figured out that I'd get a better answer if i added "handlebars" to my search. A minute
                after that i found out i needed a @. It made me :(.
            </p>
            <p>The biggest challenge in this assignment was when i was a bit more than halfway done with the assignment, I finally realized that the changes i made to the files sometimes wouldn't go through properly for one reason
                or another. Sometimes, the console would give me an error, at other times, the webpage wouldn't load properly or wouldn't show the change. Many times, i would make a change and it wouldn't work
                as intended, either giving an error or some other unintended result, and I would assume that I was simply doing it wrong. After a while I'd come full circle and try the same thing, and it would work
                just fine. The first few times, i passed it off as frustration, forgetting to save before testing, or a typo, but when i was implementing the userName for the navbar, the url showed up as the title. I
                commented it out since I was confident that it was right, and a few minutes later, I uncommented it and it worked. This also confused me when i was trying to place if statements for the notes (to
                avoid printing when: or who: if there was nothing in those segments). I assumed {{#if body.when}}{{/if}} didn't work, since the console just gave me an error the first few times i tried it. I
                googled a bunch of different solutions and tried console.logging some stuff, and eventually it stopped working no matter what i added or removed. I deleted the whole section, copy-pasted the note structure
                example in the comments, and tried {{#if body.when}}{{/if}} again, and it worked just fine. I'm still not sure why it does this, but it made the assignment significantly harder that i think it should've
                been, since even if it was actually me screwing up somewhere, is still made it really hard to trust my test results.
