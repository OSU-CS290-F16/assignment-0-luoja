		<h2>Assignment 0 Entry - 9/23/2016</h2>
	    <p>I was basically clueless coming into this assignment. I completed the tutorials, but the second one ended up confusing me even 
		<br>more after I checked Piazza. Two of the questions, "[Assignment 0] Parts 3 & 4" and "Push & Submit" talked about flip and 
		<br>github (sadly, it took me a few minutes to even figure out what flip was referring to), and I couldn't really tell whether
		<br>we were supposed to be following what the second tutorial did. Thankfully, one of the kind souls in this universe put up
		<br>some screenshots on Piazza, and after messing around with it a bit, I finally came to the realization that doing the changes on
		<br>flip or github made absolutely no difference. After that epiphany, I more or less managed to make the edits and what not without
		<br>too much trouble. If I'm to summarize the troubles I had, it would be that I didn't even understand what flip and github were,
		<br>nor how the latter worked.</p>
		<p>As for what I learned, I finally have a grasp on what github is, so I think I can answer some of my questions just by messing around
		<br>with it for a bit. I also managed to figure out how to connect to my OSU Engineering directory thing as a side effect of said 
		<br>messing around. And lastly, I've definitely seen how useful Piazza is, and I'll probably be relying on it quite a bit for the 
		<br>remainder of the term.</p>
