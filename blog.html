		<h2>Assignment 0 Entry - 9/23/2016</h2>
	    <p>I was basically clueless coming into this assignment. I completed the tutorials, but the second one ended up confusing me even 
		<br>more after I checked Piazza. Two of the questions, "[Assignment 0] Parts 3 & 4" and "Push & Submit" talked about flip and 
		<br>github (sadly, it took me a few minutes to even figure out what flip was referring to), and I couldn't really tell how the
		<br>two were related. Thankfully, one of the kind souls in this universe put up some screenshots on Piazza, and after messing 
		<br>around with it a bit, I finally came to the realization that doing the changes on flip or github made little to no 
		<br>difference. After that epiphany, I more or less managed to make the edits and what not without too much trouble. If I'm
		<br>to summarize the troubles I had, it would be that I didn't even understand what flip and github were, nor how the latter 
		<br>worked.</p>
		<p>As for what I learned, I finally have a grasp on what github is, so I think I can answer some of my questions just by messing around
		<br>with it for a bit. I also managed to figure out how to connect to my OSU Engineering directory thing as a side effect of said 
		<br>messing around. And lastly, I've definitely seen how useful Piazza is, and I'll probably be relying on it quite a bit for the 
		<br>remainder of the term.</p>
