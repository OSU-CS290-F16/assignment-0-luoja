    <h2>Web Development Skills</h2>
    <p>On a scale from 0 to 10, my confidence in my web development skills is a 0 or 1. I've looked at html once or twice 
       <br> a few years ago, and then never saw it again. Everything so far (html, github, etc.) has been new to me.</p>
    
    <h2>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h2>
    <p>I guess I just hope to learn about web development in general. I know this answer isn't a very good one, but my knowledge 
        <br>on this subject is so lacking that I dont even understand what we're going to be learning in the first place. For 
        <br>now, I just want to be able to understand html and github so that I can understand what's going on during lecture.</p>
    
    <h2>Have you signed up for Piazza?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    
    <h2>A unique experience</h2>
	<p>Three years ago, I rolled up a giant snowball, probably a little over a meter in diameter, in a tot lot near my house. 
    <br>It took me and both my parents to roll it down just one block to my front yard, and the whole ordeal took around
    <br>two hours. As for the reason why I did it, it was really just because I thought it was fun. Now, I know that it was
    <br>worthwhile simply based on the fact that I can still remeber it quite clearly, despite having little recollection
    <br>of the rest of the year.</p>
