    <h2>Web Development Skills</h2>
    <p>On a scale from 0 to 10, my confidence in my web development skills is a 0 or 1. I've looked at html once or twice 
       <br> a few years ago, and then never saw it again. Everything so far (html, github, etc.) has been new to me.</p>
    
    <h2>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h2>
    <p>I guess I just hope to learn about web development in general. I know this answer isn't a very good one, but my knowledge 
        <br>on this subject is so lacking that I dont even understand what we're going to be learning in the first place. For 
        <br>now, I just want to be able to understand html and github so that I can understand what's going on during lecture.</p>
    
    <h2>Have you signed up for Piazza?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    
    <h2>An interesting fact/unique experience</h2>
    <p>I can't really think of any kind of interesting fact, but if I had to say something, I guess it would be that
      <br>during school, I almost always eat the same thing, every day, for every meal: a sandwich. I do it because it's 
      <br>cheap, fast, and I don't care too much about the food I eat. As for a unique experience, I once rolled up a giant
      <br>snowball, and I spent about two hours rolling it down just one block to the front of my house.</p>
